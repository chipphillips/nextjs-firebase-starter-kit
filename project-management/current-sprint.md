## Task Distribution Summary
- Frontend Developer (FD): 6 tasks
- Full Stack Developer (FSD): 8 tasks
- UI/UX Designer (UX): 2 tasks
- QA Engineer (QA): 3 tasks

This distribution aims to balance the workload while aligning tasks with each team member's expertise. The Frontend and Full Stack Developers have the most tasks due to the nature of the sprint goals. The UI/UX Designer focuses on accessibility-related tasks, while the QA Engineer leads the testing efforts and performance audit.

## Updates
- Implemented error boundaries for top-level components (RootLayout and LandingPage)
- Created a reusable ErrorBoundary component for future use
- Created custom 404 and 500 error pages
- Implemented loading states for asynchronous operations using Suspense and a LoadingSpinner component
- Implemented retry mechanisms for failed API calls using a custom utility function
- Added logging functionality for failed API calls to improve monitoring and debugging
- Created unit tests for apiUtils functions to ensure reliability
- Next steps: Focus on accessibility enhancements and component testing
